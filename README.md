## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- (Optional) [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- (Optional) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables (e.g., `Admin__Key`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`).
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Access the applications:
   - **Frontend:** [http://localhost](http://localhost)
   - **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   - **NASCAR Live Feed:** [http://localhost:8080/api/nascar/live](http://localhost:8080/api/nascar/live)

## ✨ Features

- **Live NASCAR Tracking:** Automated polling of official NASCAR feeds with configurable intervals.
- **Historical Data Import:** Secured admin endpoints to import and store historical race lists and weekend feeds in PostgreSQL.
- **Race Snapshots:** Quick view of leaders, status, and lap counts.
- **Multi-Series Support:** Dashboard prepared for both NASCAR and Formula 1 data. NASCAR pages read live data from the backend; F1 pages are scaffolded with placeholder data pending the F1 integration.

## 🛠 Development

### Backend
To run the backend locally without Docker:
```bash
cd backend
dotnet run
```

### Frontend
To run the frontend locally in development mode:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
